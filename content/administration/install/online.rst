Demo
----

To simply get a quick idea of Odoo, demo_ instances are available. They are
shared instances which only live for a few hours, and can be used to browse
around and try things out with no commitment.

Demo_ instances require no local installation, just a web browser.

Odoo Online
-----------

Trivial to start with, fully managed and migrated by Odoo S.A., `Odoo Online`_
provides private instances and starts out free. It can be used to discover and
test Odoo and do non-code customizations (i.e. incompatible with custom modules
or the Odoo Apps Store) without having to install it locally.

Can be used for both testing Odoo and long-term production use.

Like demo_ instances, `Odoo Online`_ instances require no local installation, a web
browser is sufficient.
