   :align: center
   :alt: Identification number and the document type set in Odoo.

.. tip::
   When the :guilabel:`Document Type` is `NIT` the :guilabel:`Identification Number` needs to be
   configured in Odoo including the *verification digit*, Odoo will split this number when the data
   to the third party vendor is sent.

Fiscal information
******************

The partner's responsibility codes (section 53 in the RUT document) are included as part of the
electronic invoice module given it is part of the information required by the |DIAN|.

the partner.

Products
~~~~~~~~

In addition to adding the basic information in the product form, the :guilabel:`UNSPSC Category`,
:guilabel:`Barcode` or the :guilabel:`Internal Reference` field should be configured.

   :alt: Configuring the UNSPSC Category field in Odoo on a product form.

Taxes

:guilabel:`Advanced Options` tab needs to be configured per tax.

Retention tax types (:guilabel:`ICA`, :guilabel:`IVA`, :guilabel:`Fuente`) are also included in the
options to configure taxes. This configuration is used in order to correctly display taxes in the
invoice PDF.

bills, the purchase journals related to their supporting documents need to be updated in Odoo. The
process is similar to the configuration of the sales journals.

:menuselection:`Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`

.. _colombia/invoice-validation:

Invoice validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the invoice is confirmed, an :file:`.XML` file is created and sent automatically to Carvajal.
The invoice will be processed asynchronously by the E-invoicing service: UBL 2.1 (Colombia).

This file is also displayed in the chatter.

with the name of the :file:`.XML` file. Additionally, the :guilabel:`Electronic Invoice Status`
field is displayed with the initial value :guilabel:`In progress`.

   :alt: Electronic Invoice EDI Document XML file in the EDI Documents tab.

.. _colombia/invoice-xml:

structure and the information in it.

In the :menuselection:`Action` dropdown, select the :guilabel:`Check Carvajal Status` button. If
everything is correct the :guilabel:`Electronic Invoice Status` field value changes to
:guilabel:`Validated`. Then, proceed to generate a legal XML which includes a digital signature and

A :file:`.ZIP` containing the legal electronic invoice in XML format and the invoice in PDF format
is downloaded and displayed in the invoice chatter:
